    <h3>Written and recomended to all by ResidentMujahid</h3>
    <p>Firstly I would like to mention a fact that Switzerland is the best and most beautiful country in the world</p>
    <p>This is a bit of what i'm refering to:
      Switzerland is a mountainous Central European country, home to numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps. Its cities contain medieval quarters, with landmarks like capital Bern’s Zytglogge clock tower and Lucerne’s wooden chapel bridge. The country is also known for its ski resorts and hiking trails. Banking and finance are key industries, and Swiss watches and chocolate are world renowned.</p>

    <p>Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, is built around a crook in the Aare River. It traces its origins back to the 12th century, with medieval architecture preserved in the Altstadt (Old Town). The Swiss Parliament and diplomats meet in the Neo-Renaissance Bundeshaus (Federal Palace). The Französische Kirche (French Church) and the nearby medieval tower known as the Zytglogge both date to the 13th century.

The Gothic Cathedral of Bern has 15th-century stained glass windows and views over the Altstadt’s red roofs from its commanding spire. Across the Kirchenfeldbrücke – one of 18 bridges over the Aare – the Bern Historical Museum incorporates an Einstein Museum dedicated to the famous physicist and former city resident. Works by 20th-century artist Paul Klee are the focus of Zentrum Paul Klee, a modern museum with an undulating roof designed by Renzo Piano. The Kunstmuseum spans European art history. Bears, a mascot of the city, can be viewed in their riverside habitat, BärenPark.</p>

    <p>The city of Zurich, a global center for banking and finance, lies at the north end of Lake Zurich in northern Switzerland. The picturesque lanes of the central Altstadt (Old Town), on either side of the Limmat River, reflect its pre-medieval history. Waterfront promenades like the Limmatquai follow the river toward the 17th-century Rathaus (town hall).

Augustinergasse is a colorful old-world street, known for the carved windows of former merchants’ houses. Shopping boulevard Bahnhofsstrasse is lined with high-end fashion stores and banks. Niederdorf is a popular nightlife area. The 9th-century Fraumünster church houses Marc Chagall's 1970s stained-glass windows, and the Grossmünster’s tower has views of the city, lake and Alps. The Landesmuseum traces Swiss culture over thousands of years. Cabaret Voltaire, a cafe/bar that's still in operation, was the 1916 birthplace of the Dada art movement. Work by modern artists like Alberto Giacometti is on display at the Kunsthaus museum.</p>

    <p>Geneva is a city in Switzerland that lies at the southern tip of expansive Lac Léman (Lake Geneva). Surrounded by the Alps and Jura mountains, the city has views of dramatic Mont Blanc. Headquarters of Europe’s United Nations and the Red Cross, it’s a global hub for diplomacy and banking. French influence is widespread, from the language to gastronomy and bohemian districts like Carouge.

A signature site is the Jet d’Eau fountain, which shoots up 140m above Lake Geneva. On the Rhône River’s Left Bank, the cobbled Old Town features the Jardin Anglais’ landscaped Flower Clock, the Reformation bastion St. Pierre Cathedral and cafe-lined square Place du Bourg-de-Four. High-end Swiss watches and chocolate are staples of the city center’s luxury shops. The river's Right Bank is home to pristine parks and museums like the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire, with an expansive collection of European art and archaeological objects. Its Les Pâquis is a neighborhood with funky bistros, nightclubs and boutiques.</p>
    <p>That's enough to get a person's intrest and make him/her like Switzerland if not love it.</p>
